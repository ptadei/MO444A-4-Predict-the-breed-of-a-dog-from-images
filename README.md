# MO444A-Assignment-4
MO444 - 2018s1 - Activity #4 - Prof. Anderson Rocha (anderson.rocha@ic.unicamp.br)

Objective
Predict the breed of a dog from images.

Activities
1. Engineer your features. Here you do not have them for free. You need to think of
possible ways for transforming the collected data into meaningful features. For some
ideas, consider traditional features such as texture features, color features, bags of
visual words or more powerful ones involving CNNs. If you cannot think of anything,
talk to the professor for some ideas.
2. Propose classification techniques to solve the problem. Suggestions here are the CNN
directly, or SVMs/Random Forests allied with CNNs through the use of transfer
learning.
3. Consider using data augmentation in the training (what about in the testing as well?)
4. Observation: You are free to use any solution to help you extract the features at this
point.
5. Report all of your results for the validation and test data. The labels for the test will be
released one week before the deadline.

Metric

1. The classification metrics to be used in this assignment are Normalized Accuracy
and F1.

Dataset
Images in the training set were captured with different camera models. There are 83 classes
with 100 images for training for each class. In the validation, there is 73 images per class.
In the training and validation, the data files follow the format xx_yyyy.jpg, where xx denotes
the class (from 00 to 82) and yyyy is the image id in the class. In the test, the filenames are
random.
The datasets are available at:
1. IC/Unicamp
----
2. Dropbox

Deadline
Monday, June 4th in the beginning of the class.
Submission
Bring your 4-page printed report and submit during class on the deadline day. This activity is with
PAIRS (teams of two).
